# The D programming language by Walter Bright

<time>Posted on 10th July 2013 by [Gary Willoughby](/nomad.uk.net/pages/about.html)</time>

This is a good introduction to the D programming language by none other than the author himself. I'm a big fan of D and thought I would share this to educate any other interested developers.

The D Programming Language combines modeling power, modern convenience, and native efficiency into one powerful language. D embodies many new ideas in programming languages along with traditional proven techniques. Filmed at Lang.NEXT 2012, a cross-industry conference for programming language designers and implementers on the Microsoft Campus in Redmond, Washington. With three days of talks, panels and discussion on leading programming language work from industry and research, Lang.NEXT is the place to learn, share ideas and engage with fellow programming language design experts and enthusiasts. Native, functional, imperative, object oriented, static, dynamic, managed, interpretedâ€¦ It's a programming language geek fest.
