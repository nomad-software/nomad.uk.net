# About

<time>Posted on 7th July 2013 by [Gary Willoughby]($root-path$/pages/about.html)</time>

Hi, my name is Gary Willoughby, I live in the UK and I’m a software engineer.

I indulge in the craft of software development as a creative endeavor and I love the challenge posed by problems all software developers face. I’m also someone who likes to do things properly, so where possible I always adhere to best practices and good coding standards. I read a great deal of books on software development and continue to hone my craft, hopefully improving year on year as I learn to be more professional and robust in my approaches to software problems.

A few years ago I wrote a book titled [PureBasic – A Beginner’s Guide To Computer Programming]($root-path$/downloads/PureBasic%20-%20A%20Beginners%20Guide.pdf) which uses the PureBasic language as a platform to teach beginners how to program computers and how to create their own applications and games. I was quite shocked by its popularity and after a lot of community persuasion decided to release it under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike License.

## Why write a blog?

This blog is where I can rant and rave about all the different aspects of software development, save code and ideas for later and somewhere where readers and I can both learn from each other. What better way is there to reach other like minded developers than to keep a journal of ideas and thoughts that hopefully will help our community as a whole. Plus, it’s also a storage facility for me, so I don’t forget this stuff!
